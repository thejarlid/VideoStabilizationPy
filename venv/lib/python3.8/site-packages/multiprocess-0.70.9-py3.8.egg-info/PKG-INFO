        About Multiprocess
        ====================
        
        ``multiprocess`` is a fork of ``multiprocessing``, and is developed as part of ``pathos``: 
        https://github.com/uqfoundation/pathos
        
        ``multiprocessing`` is a package for the Python language which supports the
        spawning of processes using the API of the standard library's
        ``threading`` module. ``multiprocessing`` has been distributed in the standard
        library since python 2.6.
        
        Features:
        
            - Objects can be transferred between processes using pipes or multi-producer/multi-consumer queues.
            - Objects can be shared between processes using a server process or (for simple data) shared memory.
            - Equivalents of all the synchronization primitives in ``threading`` are available.
            - A ``Pool`` class makes it easy to submit tasks to a pool of worker processes.
        
        
        ``multiprocess`` is part of ``pathos``,  a python framework for heterogeneous computing.
        ``multiprocess`` is in active development, so any user feedback, bug reports, comments,
        or suggestions are highly appreciated.  A list of known issues is maintained at http://trac.mystic.cacr.caltech.edu/project/pathos/query.html, with a public ticket list at https://github.com/uqfoundation/multiprocess/issues.
        
        NOTE: A C compiler is required to build the included extension module. For python 3.3 and above, a C compiler is suggested, but not required.
        
        
        Major Changes
        ==============
        
            - enhanced serialization, using ``dill``
        
        
        Current Release
        ===============
        
        This documentation is for version ``multiprocess-0.70.9`` (a fork of ``multiprocessing-0.70a1``).
        
        The latest released version of ``multiprocess`` is available from::
        
            https://pypi.org/project/multiprocess
        
        ``Multiprocessing`` is distributed under a BSD license.

        Installation
        ============
        
        ``multiprocess`` is packaged to install from source, so you must
        download the tarball, unzip, and run the installer::
        
            [download]
            $ tar -xvzf multiprocess-0.70.9.tgz
            $ cd multiprocess-0.70.9
            $ python setup.py build
            $ python setup.py install
        
        You will be warned of any missing dependencies and/or settings
        after you run the "build" step above.
        
        Alternately, ``multiprocess`` can be installed with ``pip`` or ``easy_install``::
        
            $ pip install multiprocess
        
        NOTE: A C compiler is required to build the included extension module from source. For python 3.3 and above, a C compiler is suggested, but not required. Binary installs do not require a C compiler.
        
        
        Requirements
        ============
        
        ``multiprocess`` requires::
        
            - ``python``, **version >= 2.5** or **version >= 3.1**
            - ``dill``, **version >= 0.3.1**
        
        Optional requirements::
        
            - ``setuptools``, **version >= 0.6**
        
        
        More Information
        ================
        
        Probably the best way to get started is to look at the documentation at
        http://multiprocess.rtfd.io. See ``multiprocess.examples`` for a set of example
        scripts. You can also run the test suite with ``python -m multiprocess.tests``.
        Please feel free to submit a ticket on github, or ask a question on
        stackoverflow (**@Mike McKerns**).  If you would like to share how you use
        ``multiprocess`` in your work, please post send an email
        (to **mmckerns at uqfoundation dot org**).
